	<h2>Hardware</h2>

	<h3>Definition</h3>

	<div>
	Computer hardware is a collective term used to describe any of the physical components of an analog or digital computer. The term hardware distinguishes the tangible aspects of a computing device from software, which consists of written instructions that tell physical components what to do.

   <h2>Software</h2>
   <h3>Introduction</h3>

   <div>
   Software is a set of <em>instructions, data or programs</em> used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. Opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer, software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. Software can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, and hardware the invariable part.
